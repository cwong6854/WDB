            <h2>Description of Web Developer:</h2>
            <p>A web developer is a programmer or a coder who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack developer). A web content management system may be used to develop and maintain web applications.</p>

            <p>There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles which teach web development, freely available on the web - for example, on Basic JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Even though there are no formal requirements, web development projects require web developers to have advanced knowledge and skills such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML/XHTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery</li>
                <li>Ability to utilize a database</li>
                <li>Server/client side architecture like all or some of the above mentioned</li>
                <li>Creating single page application with the use of front-end tools such as EmberJS, ReactJS or AngularJS</li>
            </ul>
        </footer>
